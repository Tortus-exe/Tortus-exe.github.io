# Sentences

Friends of mine often hear me say that Cantonese is the caveman language. Compared to English, that is no mistake: Cantonese sentences often are much simpler than their English counterparts. Consider the following English sentences, their translations, and their word-by-word breakdown.

- I went to the seven-eleven to buy some milk only to realize they actually don't sell it.
    - 我去咗七十一想買奶，但一到咗呢就發覺佢哋都唔賣
    - I go -ed 7 11 want buy milk, but once arrive -ed then realize they also not sell (it)
- My TV broke, but it's one of a kind so I decided to hire this TV genius to help us!
    - 我部電視懷咗，不過係冇得買返嘅，咁我寧願請呢個師傅幫我哋修理呀！
    - My TV break -ed, but is unable buy again, so I decided hire this guru help us repair (it)!
- Can you give me a ride?
    - 你可唔可以車我呀
    - you can not- can drive me?

No conjugations, no tenses, and no real rules other than where you put words. Easy! So, how do we string words together?

Cantonese sentences follow a SVO pattern. That is, Subject-Verb-Object. In layman's terms, it is the exact same as English. If in English you would say "I went to the store", you would say "我去咗鋪頭" in Cantonese. Since the word order is the same, "我" means "I", "去咗" means "went", and "鋪頭" means "store". Easy!

Here are some useful words:

| Word | Reading  |  Meaning  |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 我   | ngo̗      | me/I      |
| 你   | ne̗i      | you       |
| 佢   | kø̗i      | he/she/it |
| 我哋  | ngo̗ de̱i  | we        |
| 你哋  | ne̗i de̱i  | y'all     |
| 佢哋  | kø̗i de̱i  | they      |
| 去   | høi     | go        |
| 買   | ma̗ai    | buy       |
| 食   | si̱k     | eat       |
| 學校  | ho̱k ha̱au | school    |
| 飯    | fa̱an     | rice/meal |
| 禮物  | la̗i ma̱t  | present   |

Using these words, can you construct the following sentences?

- I go to school.
- He buys presents.
- You guys eat a meal.
- It eats schools.
- We go to rice.
- They eat presents.

Don't overthink it. Plural forms and articles don't exist in Cantonese, unlike in English. 
Though it may not be practical for one to know how to say "Those things go to presents", it certainly is funny. What other funny sentences can you make with these words?
