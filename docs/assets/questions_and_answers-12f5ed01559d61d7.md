# What??

Questions can be divided into mostly two types: Yes and No questions, and open-ended questions. They are formed differently, so we will speak about each briefly, and end with some practice questions.

## Yes and No!

To form a yes and no question, we must first know how to negate words. Cantonese has a negation particle "唔" (m̖). Placing this before any word will cause it to become a negative!

- 唔去 (m̖ høi): don't go
- 唔嚟 (m̖ le̖i): don't come
- 唔完 (m̖ yv̖n): don't finish

And so, we can form questions by placing the verb next to its negated form. If I want to ask if my unemployed couch-crashing friend is going to go on a walk with me for once, I can ask "go-not go?"

- 去唔去? (høi m̖ høi): will you go?

The lack of an ending particle can make this sound a bit strict, so most people like to add the end particle "呀" (aa) to the ends of their questions. This makes it seem more friendly. 

- 去唔去呀? (høi m̖ høi aa): would you like to go?

Now our roommate friend is not feeling so terrible anymore.
Please note that when asking about the existence of something, the negative of "to exist" (有, ya̗u) is actually irregular. It should not be 唔有, as one might expect, but rather 無 (mo̗u). This character has an alternate form that Cantonese speakers prefer to use: 冇 (also pronounced mo̗u).
Also note that when a verb has more than one character, such as 可以 (ho̗ yi̗, to be able to), only pair the first character with its negative. See these examples.

- 你有冇信用卡呀? (ne̗i ya̗u mo̗u sø̱n yu̱ng kāat aa): Do you have a credit card?
- 你可唔可以開門呀? (ne̗i ho̗ m̖ ho̗ yi̗ hōi mu̱n aa): Can you open the door?
- 你係唔係痴咗呀?! (ne̗i ha̱i m̖ ha̱i cī jó aa): Are you crazy?!
- 你食唔食藥呀? (ne̗i si̱k m̖ si̱k yœ̱k aa): Do you take any medicine?
- 你係唔係老過18歲? (ne̗i ha̱i m̖ ha̱i lóu gwo sa̱p ba̱at sø̱i aa): Are you older than 18 years old?

## Open ended questions!

Open ended questions require special vocabulary. We will split these questions into 6 categories depending on their construction. 

### What?

What: 乜嘢 (māt ye̗), commonly contracted as 咩(mē)

- What is that? 嗰個嘢咩嚟㗎? (gó go yé mē le̖i ga̱a)
- What do you want? 你要咩呀? (ne̗i yi̱u mē aa)
- What are you doing? 你做𡁵咩呀? (ne̗i zo̱u gán mē aa)

Who: 邊個 (bīn go)

- Who drank my soda? 邊個飲咗我嘅可樂呀? (bīn go yám zó ngo̗ ga̱ hó lo̱k aa)
- Who is responsible? 邊個有責任呀? (bīn go ya̗u zaak ya̱m aa)

Where: 邊喥 (bīn do̱u)

- Where are you? 你喺邊喥呀? (ne̗i ha̗i bīn do̱u aa)
- Honey, where are my pants? 呀小啤，我對褲去咗邊喥呀? (aa si̗u bī, ngo̗ døi fu høi zó bīn do̱u aa) lit. where did my pants go?

Why: 點解 (di̗m ga̗ai)

- Why are you here? 點解你嚟咗呢喥呀? (di̗m ga̗ai ne̗i le̱i zó nī do̱u aa)
- Why is the sky blue? 點解嘅天空會係藍色嘅? (di̗m ga̗ai ga tīn hōng wúi ha̱i na̖am sīk gé)

How: 點樣 (di̗m yœ̗ng) - in what way

- How do you go to school? 你點樣去學校呀? (ne̗i di̗m yœ̄ng høi ho̱k ha̱au aa)

幾 (ge̗i) - To what degree

- How old are you? 你幾歲呀? (ne̗i ge̗i sø̱i aa)
- What time is it? 而家幾點呀? (yi̱ gāa ge̗i di̗m aa)

All open ended questions are formulated under one of these five categories. 

## Practice

Now that you know how to form the following questions, here's a summary of the words we've learned so far:

| Word | Reading  |  Meaning       |
|------|----------|----------------|
| 唔   | m̖        | not            |
| 乜嘢  | māt ye̗   | what          |
| 咩   | mē       | what           |
| 邊個  | bīn go   | who            |
| 邊喥  | bīn do̱u  | where          |
| 點解  | di̗m ga̗ai | why            |
| 點樣  | di̗m yœ̗ng | in what way    |
| 幾   | ge̗i      | to what extent |

And a few more words that we came across in this chapter:

| Word | Reading  |  Meaning       |
|------|----------|----------------|
| 完   | yv̖n      | to finish      |
| 係   | ha̱i      | to be          |
| 痴   | cī       | to go insane   |
| 開   | hōi      | to open        |
| 要   | yiu      | to need/want   |
| 做   | jo̱u      | to do          |
| 有   | ya̗u      | to exist/have  |
| 冇   | mo̗u      | don't exist/have |
| 信用卡 | sø̱n yu̱ng kāat | credit card |
| 學校  | ho̱k ha̱au | school         |
| 門   | mu̱n      | door           |
| 褲   | fu       | pants          |
| 藥   | yœ̱k      | medicine       |
| 老   | lo̗u      | old            |
| 藍色  | na̖am sīk | blue           |
| 歲   | sø̱i      | years old      |


So, using these words, try to form the following sentences:
- Where am I?
- Where did we go? 
- Who are you?
- What are you doing? (remember the -ing ending from last chapter!)
- I don't have the blue drugs!
- Do you want the blue drugs?
- Are you insane?
- Are we done?
- Do you need my credit card? (use 嘅, ga, to denote posession. e.g. 你嘅 = your)
