r#"# Welcome!

So you actually would like to learn some Cantonese? Out of all the languages you could have chosen, you chose one of the most difficult languages for English speakers to learn?
You must either hate yourself, really love languages, or both.
Let's learn a bit about how this language works.
Also - I heard once that there would be concerns of tone-deaf people learning this language. YOU CAN DO IT TOO. You might have to work towards it a bit, but *you can do it*. 

### `HISTORY`

Cantonese was a language that was spoken around the Yue area in southeast China. It is most notable for being spread around the Guangzhou region. Areas where Cantonese spread most plentifully is shown in pink.

Because my speaking experience comes from the dialects used in Hong Kong, that is what I will be teaching. The local dialect has some differences with standard Cantonese, but now since the city may be the largest Cantonese-speaking population in the region today, one might regard it as standard in some sense.

### `PHONETICS`

Cantonese is a tonal language. Essentially, this means that different words can be told apart based on the pitch pattern contour they follow. 
If this made no sense to you, you are not alone. Here is an exercise to try to understand what I mean. 

- A: \"Did you hear about the accident yesterday?\"
- B: \"*Huh*? What happened?\"
- A: \"The maple syrup factory sprung a leak, and all the machinery got gummed up!\"
- B: \"*Huh*. Neat.\"

In these two sentences, the exclamation \"*Huh*\" is highlighted. However, notice the pronunciation. The first *Huh* is pronounced in a way that indicates that I am asking something. The second *Huh* has a different tone, pitching down instead of up. Now imagine if those two different *Huh* sounds had completely different meanings, like if the pitching up one meant \"car\" and the interest one meant \"book\". That's what it means for a language to be tonal. 

Cantonese has six tones. Some purport it has nine, but in reality the seventh, eighth, and ninth are tones 1, 3, and 6 with consonants at the end, rather than individual unique contours.

Unfortunately, a graph like this will be nigh impossible to understand. So, here is an audio clip of someone pronouncing all six tones.

note: there used to be an audio tag here, but due to the new website, it is currently unavailable. Sorry. I will get it working as soon as I can manage.

Interestingly, the exact pitch does not matter. It is instead how high or low those pitches are **relative** to each other that matters. Here is my voice speaking Cantonese.

Thus, one can feel free to adjust the pitches based on how they feel comfortable, as long as there is an audible difference between each tone.
Training to hear the differences can be quite difficult initially. With time, you can distinguish them easily.

These six tones will be distinguished with six tone markers:

sī sí si̇ si̖ si̗ si̲

this goes hand in hand with the writing system we will soon describe.

### `READING AND WRITING`

Cantonese uses *traditional chinese characters* to write and read. Traditional chinese characters look like the following:

哈囉！如果你讀得到呢條句，你應該唔使在學廣東話呀吧！

Because English speakers who are untrained in reading Chinese cannot read this without straining their brains, we will adopt a system of my own design to learn how to pronounce each word.

### `THE SYSTEM`

Cantonese has the following consonants:

m n ŋ p t k kʷ ʔ pʰ tʰ kʰ kʰʷ t͡s t͡sʰ f s h l j w

To those of you who are not linguists, think of the following consonants from English:
- m: **m**ew, **m**old
- n: **n**ever, **n**ull
- ŋ: bri**ng**, ha**ng**ar
- p: **b**uck, **b**uild
- t: **d**ungeon, **d**ragons
- k: **g**um, **g**old
- kʷ: **Gu**atemala, pen**gu**in
- ʔ: uh**-**oh (the blank space in between is a glottal stop. See Wikipedia)
- pʰ: **p**unt, **p**lunder
- tʰ: **t**on, **t**eal
- kʰ: **Qu**estion, **Qu**eer
- ts: li**ds**, o**dds** are
- t͡sʰ: stree**ts**, i**t's** a ...
- f: **f**un, **f**eminine
- s: **s**um, **s**old
- h: **h**ut, **h**ouse
- l: **l**ick, **l**ord
- j: **y**ou, **y**ard
- w: **w**on, **w**illow

Then, there are the following vowels:

i y u e ɛ ɵ œ o ɔ ɐ a

Unfortunately, English alone will not be much help this time. I will provide audio in the future, but for now, please reference the following sounds found in other languages:
- i: bl**ee**d
- y: (in German) **ü**berf**ü**llt
- u: f**oo**d
- e: **i**ll w**i**ll
- ɛ: s**e**nd
- ɵ: (in French) j**e** m**e**
- œ: (in French) j**eu**ne
- o: b**oo**k
- ɔ: l**aw**, **au**bergine
- ɐ: **a**nother, bl**u**nt
- a: **AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**HHHHHH!!!!

If you have a sense of humour, the last one made you laugh. Also, I am Canadian, so we spell humour with a U. That last one was less funny.

Anyway, I don't like IPA, but I also don't like how Cantonese is traditionally romanized, i.e. with Jyutping. Thus, a system that is less confusing (and where j doesn't make the Y sound) was devised. All letters have the same pronunciation as they would in English.
- m
- n
- ng
- b
- d
- g
- gw
- p
- t
- k
- kw
- dz
- ts
- f
- s
- h
- l
- j
- w

The consonants are as follows:
- aa: **AAAA**HH
- a: f**u**n
- e: bl**e**nd
- ø: (in French) j**eu**ne
- o: l**aw**
- ou: l**ow**
- i: s**ee**m
- ii: **i**nner
- v: (in German) **ü**berf**ü**llt
- uu: f**oo**d
- u: b**oo**k
