r#"## Imperatives

We could ask people kindly to do things for us, or we could very strongly emphasize how much we need something done. To do this, we use the imperative form to tell others to do something. 
To form the imperative, we can simply stick the particle 啦 (lāa) at the end of a sentence. Magically, the sentence will be interpreted as a command to do something.

- 你去買奶啦! (ne̗i høi ma̗ai na̗ai lāa): go buy milk!
- 你決啲返嚟啦! (ne̗i faai dī fāan le̖i lāa): come back quickly!

Note that if you take away the particle 啦 you will end up with a full sentence describing what it is you intend the other person to do.

- 你去買奶: you go to buy milk.
- 你決啲返嚟: you hurry home.

Though these sentences may sound strange, they are grammatically correct. Try translating the following imperatives into Cantonese using the vocabulary from the previous chapters.

- Eat medicine!
- Open the door!
- Go to the store!

# No Pronouns here!

We can actually drop the 你 pronoun, though it can come off as more rude in some cases. 

- 去買奶啦! (høi ma̗ai na̗ai lāa): go buy milk!
- 決啲返嚟啦! (faai dī fāan le̖i lāa): come back quickly!

This has a bit more of a forceful or nagging tone, and can be used in emergencies to great effect. 

- 決啲打去醫院啦! (faai dī dáa høi yī yv́n lāa): Call the ambulance, quick!!

Try translating the same three imperatives into a more forceful form.

- Eat medicine!
- Open the door!
- Go to the store!

# Be nice!

Finally, we can be a bit more kind by placing 唔該 (m̖ gōi), meaning \"please\" in front of our imperatives. For example: 

- 唔該你去買奶啦. (m̖ gōi ne̗i høi ma̗ai na̗ai lāa): please go buy milk.

Note that this can also be taken to be a bit sarcastic, much like English. So be careful.
Try translating the same three imperatives into a more... kind form."#;
