r#"# Time and Tenses

By now, you have learned to form some basic sentences. Congratulations! Let's add some more detail to those sentences by teaching how to say some action occurred in the past or future.

In order to add extra information to a verb, we use modifiers, otherwise known in the linguistic community as \"aspects\". A good example of this in English is the modifier \"*will*\". This modifier makes a verb happen in the future. We will focus on three of the Cantonese modifiers for now:

- ?𡁵: gán - makes a verb be currently happening. Equivalent to \"-ing\" in English
- ?咗: jó - makes a verb have happened in the past. Equivalent to \"-ed\" in English
- 會?: wu̗ui - makes a verb happen in the future. Equivalent to \"will -\" in English

Some examples using some verbs you already know:
- 會去: wu̗ui høi - will go
- 去咗: høi jó - went
- 食𡁵: si̱k gán - eating
- 食咗: si̱k jó - ate

And that's it! Try making the following sentences:

- I went to school
- He is buying the presents (right now!)
- They will go to buy presents. (don't overthink - make it as simple as possible!)
- You will go eat rice!

# Dates and Times

In Cantonese, and perhaps in many other languages, simply knowing the tense is not enough to convey much useful information. Sometimes, we want to be more specific than saying that an action was completed, or that an action will happen eventually. It is useful to know some basic words to denote nearby times and dates:

- 而家: yi̖ gāa - right now
- 頭先: ta̖u sīn - just a bit earlier
- 一陣間: yāt za̱n gāan - (in just) a moment (of time)
- 之前: zī ci̖n - earlier
- 之後: zī ha̱u - later
- 今日: gām yat - today
- 聽日: tīng yat - tomorrow
- 琴日: ka̖m ya̱t - yesterday
- 後日: ha̱u ya̱t - the day after tomorrow
- 前日: ci̱n ya̱t - the day before yesterday
- 今月: gām yv̱t - this month
- 上個月: sœ̱ng go yv̱t - last month
- 下個月: ha̱a go yv̱t - next month
- 今年: gām nín - this year
- 上年: sœ̱ng nín - last year
- 下年: ha̱a nín - next year

This is a lot of terms to remember. I will make a visual upon request! To use these terms, simply stick them at the beginning of a sentence, like you would in English. To say \"Next month, I will go to Hong Kong\", you would say: 下個月，我會去香港。

Try to translate the following sentences to get a feel for how this works!

- This month, I ate rice.
- I'll go next year! (tip: Sticking a time at the end of a sentence like this needs a trick in Cantonese. How could you change the sentence without changing its meaning so that you can translate it correctly?)
- I am eating right now.
- I'm coming over right now."#;
