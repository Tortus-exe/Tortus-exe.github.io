r#"# One, two, buckle my shoe

Cantonese, like many other asiatic languages, has a special system for numbers:

| Character | Meaning | Reading |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| 零         | zero    | li̖ng    |
| 一         | one     | yāt     |
| 二         | two     | yi̱      |
| 三         | three   | sāam    |
| 四         | four    | sei     |
| 五         | five    | ng̗      |
| 六         | six     | lu̱k     |
| 七         | seven   | tsāt    |
| 八         | eight   | baat    |
| 九         | nine    | gáu     |
| 十         | ten     | sa̱p     |
| 百         | hundred | baak    |
| 千         | thousand| cīn     |
| 萬         | ten-thousand | ma̱an |
| 憶         | hundred-million | yīk |

To form a number, we can break it down into its digits. Take, for example, the following number: 1,369,420. 
We break this number into its components. It is made of 136 ten-thousands, 9 thousands, 4 hundreds, and 2 tens. 
Thus, the number would be 一百三十六萬九千四百二十 (yāt baak sāam sa̱p lu̱k ma̱an gáu cīn sei baak yi̱ sa̱p), or \"one-hundred three-ten six ten-thousand, nine-thousand four-hundred two-ten\". 

Based on this, try to form the following numbers:
- 915
- 210
- 1300
- 123456789
- 12
- 86
- 720

Even basic numbers, like 31 (三十一) would be a mouthful to pronounce, so Cantonese offers some shortcuts to make these pronunciation easier. 

When 十 is sandwiched between two digits, as in 31, its pronunciation can be shortened from sa̱p to *a̱* or *a̱a*. Any final consonants in the previous character become eliminated. Thus, the practical pronunciations of these numbers could be: 

- 31: sāa a̱ yāt
- 96: gáu a̱ lu̱k
- 144: yāt baak sei a̱ sei
- 1,369,420: yāt baak sāa a̱ lu̱k ma̱an gáu invalid tone sei baak yi̱ sa̱p

Note that because the final 十 in the previous example is not sandwiched on both sides, it does not get shortened. This shortening also explains the special character 廿 (ya̱a) meaning 20. Thus, 26 is ya̱a lu̱k. 

There are some exceptions which make Cantonese numbers less simple, however. 
When there is a zero in the tens place, such as in 106, we must place a 零 in its place. For example: 

- 106 一百零六
- 201 二百零一
- 1,109 一千一百零九

Of course, if the number is less than a hundred, it is as we expect.
- 6 六
- 19 十九

Also, if the number is greater than a hundred and has a 1 in the tens position, we must place a 一 before the ten:

- 119 一百一十九
- 24,012 二萬四千一十二
- 9,919 九千九百一十九

Try forming these numbers using the rules you now know!

- 143
- 93,149
- 10,000,001
- 931,602,118
- 604

# Counting, counting

Numbers are one thing, but using them practically is another. Unlike in English, counting objects is not as simple as sticking a number next to the noun. In English, we can have \"*one cat*\", \"*three houses*\", or \"*ten cars*\". However, in Cantonese, we need to use *counters*. 

The concept of a counter is not absent from English. For example, you might ask for a bottle of water at the corner store, a glass of water at a friend's house, or a stream of water when you're dehydrated in the Sahara. Cantonese uses this sort of thing for every noun: 

- One cat: 一隻貓 (yāt dzek māau)
- Three houses: 三間屋 (sāam gāan 'ūk)
- Ten cars: 十架車 (sa̱p gaa cē)

There are too many counters in Cantonese to list in a single article, and far too many to know how to count every object in the universe. In general, if you forget a counter, you can always use 個 (go) as a backup plan. In fact, 個 is the dedicated counter for a few things. 

| Word | pronunciation | counter for |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| 個    | go            | people, generic objects |
| 條    | ti̖u           | long, thin, flexible objects (e.g. hair) |
| 架    | gaa           | vehicles (e.g. cars, planes) |
| 對    | døi           | a pair (e.g. of pants) |
| 舊    | ga̱u           | a chunk |
| 支    | dzī           | long, thin, solid objects (e.g. pencil |

Nearly everything has a counter in Cantonese. I will provide another resource strictly speaking about counters and classification, but it suffices to know the general counter 個 for now. 

Try counting the following: 

- a pair of doors.
- a pair of pants (note that pants are actually just one thing, not really a pair as English might suggest)
- three cars
- a block of cheese (芝士 means cheese, dzī sí)
- ten people
- A blue school
- three wooden pieces. The wooden pieces were shaved off by a car that nearly hit a telephone pole, resulting in them being long, thin shards that could give you a sliver if you rubbed your hand on them. (木 means wood, mu̱k)"#;
